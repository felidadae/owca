NUMAAllocator
=============

	
	    Allocator aimed to minimize remote NUMA memory accesses for processes.
	
	    - ``algorithm``: **NUMAAlgorithm** = *'fill_biggest_first'*:
	
	        User can choose from options: *'fill_biggest_first'*, *'minimize_migration'* to specify policy
	        determining which task is chosen to be pinned.
	
	        - *'fill_biggest_first'*
	
	            Algorithm only cares about sum of already pinned task's memory to each numa node.
	            In each step tries to pin the biggest possible task to numa node, where sum of pinned task is the lowest.
	
	        - *'minimize_migrations'*
	            
	            Algorithm tries to minimize amount of memory which needs to be remigrated between numa nodes.
	            Into consideration takes information: where a task memory is allocated (on which NUMA nodes),
	            which are nodes where the sum of pinned memory is the lowest and which are nodes where most free memory is available.
	
	    - ``loop_min_task_balance``: **float** = *0.0*:
	        
	        Minimal value of task_balance so the task is not skipped during rebalancing analysis
	        by default turn off, none of tasks are skipped due to this reason
	
	
	    - ``free_space_check``: **bool** = *False*:
	        
	        If True, then do not migrate if not enough space on target numa node.
	       
	
	    - ``migrate_pages``: **bool** = *True*:
	        
	        If use syscall "migrate pages" (forced, synchronous migrate pages of a task)
	       
	
	    - ``migrate_pages_min_task_balance``: **Optional[float]** = *0.95*:
	        
	        Works if migrate_pages == True. Then if set tells, when remigrate pages of already pinned task. 
	        If not at least migrate_pages_min_task_balance * TASK_TOTAL_SIZE bytes of memory resides on pinned node, then # tries to remigrate all pages allocated on other nodes to target node.
	
	
	    - ``cgroups_cpus_binding``: **bool** = *True*:
	        
	        cgroups based cpu pinning
	       
	
	    - ``cgroups_memory_binding``: **bool** = *False*:
	        
	        cgroups based memory binding
	        
	
	    - ``cgroups_memory_migrate``: **bool** = *False*:
	
	        cgroups based memory migrating; can be used only when 
	        cgroups_memory_binding is set to True
	
	
	    - ``dryrun``: **bool** = *False*:
	        
	        If set to True, do not make any allocations - can be used for debugging.
	
	    

NUMAAlgorithm
=============
.. code-block:: 

	solve bin packing problem by heuristic which takes the biggest first

StaticAllocator
===============
.. code-block:: 

	    Simple allocator based on rules defining relation between task labels
	    and allocation definition (set of concrete values).
	
	    The allocator reads allocation rules from a yaml file and directly
	    from constructor argument (passed as python dictionary).
	    Refer to configs/extra/static_allocator_config.yaml to see sample
	    input file for StaticAllocator.
	
	    A rule is an object with three fields:
	    - name,
	    - labels (optional),
	    - allocations.
	
	    First field is just a helper to name a rule.
	    Second field contains a dictionary, where each key is a task's label name and
	    the value is a regex defining the matching set of label values. If the field
	    is not included then all tasks match the rule.
	    The third field is a dictionary of allocations which should be applied to
	    matching tasks.
	
	    If there are multiple matching rules then the rules' allocations are merged and applied.

===
.. code-block:: 

	    Common configuration for SSL communication.
	
	    * server_verify: Union[bool, Path(absolute=True, mode=os.R_OK)] = True
